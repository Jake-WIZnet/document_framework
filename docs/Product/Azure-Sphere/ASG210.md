## Introduction

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/AzureSphere/overview/ASG210_20210210.png')} width="500"></img>

WIZnet’s ASG210 including Azure Sphere MT3620 combo designed by USI is an Azure Sphere guardian module designed to retrofit the brownfield systems that seek to add data communication with cloud service and secure remote access. ASG210 supports various interfaces - GPIOs/I2C/UART (RS232/485/422) – and public network connectivity – Wi-Fi(Ext-Ant)/Ethernet - to help reduce additional cost and add high-level security and cloud service.

ASG210’s Azure Sphere module supports high-level security system for cloud services. In public network, Data transmissions are encrypted, all Azure Sphere OS and application updates are delivered securely via Microsoft Azure Sphere Security Service, and authentication ensures the module only communicates with trusted hosts. With ASG210, On-premise systems can more confidently communicate existing devices with the cloud to operate more efficiently.

WIZnet ASG210 includes Azure Sphere systems. Customers will need an Azure tenant, which is free, to enable the automated Azure Sphere security and OS updates.
