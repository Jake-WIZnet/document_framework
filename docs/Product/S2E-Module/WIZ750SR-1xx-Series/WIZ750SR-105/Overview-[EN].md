## Overview

WIZ750SR-105 is a compact sized serial to Ethernet module using the
W7500 Ethernet MCU (SoC based on ARM Cortex-M0 architecture) with an
external PHY (IC+). WIZ750SR-105 is a protocol converter that transmits
data sent by serial equipment as TCP/IP data and converts the TCP/IP
data received through the network back into serial data to the serial
equipment. It complies with industrial temperature standard.

**WIZ750SR-105 is compatible\[1\] with the WIZnet WIZ100SR S2E module.**
In addition, WIZ750SR-100 contains an 4-pin GPIO expansion port that can
be controlled freely by the user as analog inputs or digital in/outputs.

The WIZ750SR-105 is compatible with the AT command set from
WIZ107SR/WIZ750SR as the firmware and the configuration tool is the same
for the board family. Users can select various kinds of boards simply by
changing the board selection in the firmware. (ex WIZ750SR,
WIZ750SR-100, WIZ750SR-105, WIZ750SR-110)

**WIZ750SR-105 is the best fit solution to control user's serial device
via Ethernet network.**
