# Overview

Cookie is Open-Source Hardware platform and is provided
from CooCox. Cookie is Hardware compatible Arduino Board and based on
Cortex M core instead of AVR. So, it can use with Arduino Shield as
[ioShield-A](Product/Open-Source-Hardware/ioShield-A.md).
[ioShield-A](Product/Open-Source-Hardware/ioShield-A.md) allows
Cookie to connect to the Internet.

Cookie is developed on IDE as CoIDE provided from CooCox, and For
reducing host dependency code provides with CoX peripheral interface
library.
