## Description

The W5300-TOE-Shield is a board that enables high-speed bus communication with the W5300 and ST's Coretex MCU.The W5300-TOE-Shield is a board that can be mounted on a Nucleo board. Individual actions cannot be performed without the Nucleo board, and only the Nucleo-F429 board is currently supported. It also supports various shield boards in the form of Arduino Shield. However, the pinmap has changed a little in the process of using the W5300, so please refer to the pin map below.
