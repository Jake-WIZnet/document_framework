# Driver

The ioLibrary means **"Internet Offload Library"** for WIZnet chip. It
includes **drivers** and **application protocols**. There are three
kinds of libraries explained on this page The first two drivers
(ioLibrary\_BSD, ioLibrary) can be used for
[W5500](/products/w5500/start) application designs. These will be
updated continuously. The former BSD-Type driver will not be updated, as
it is only meant to be a migration help from W5200 to
[W5500](/products/w5500/start).
